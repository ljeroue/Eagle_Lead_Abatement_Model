# Eagle_Lead_Abatement_Model
Determines mitigation effort needed for reducing eagle mortality from lead poisoning based on Cochrane et al. (2015).

The model incorporates two mitigation scenarios at default intensities 0% - 100% at 10% increments.

Mitigation Scenarios:
1)	Reduce the number of gut piles containing lead
2)	Reduce lead in the gut piles by converting hunters to non-lead shot

## Model Input
A .csv file containing 
- hunt unit name
- hunt unit area in km2
- total deer harvest for each respective hunt unit
- eagle density for each hunt unit

Deer harvest reports by county/hunt unit can be found on the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) website for each specific state.
For example, Iowa DNR Deer & Turkey Harvest Report can be found [here](https://gooutdoorsiowa.com/RealTimeHarvestReport.aspx).
Eagle density is not as easily available...
